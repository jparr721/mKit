# mKit Library v0.1.0
The MKit library is a series of python classes dedicated to machine learning algorithms and their "from scratch" implementation. This should not be used as a formal replacement for the already extremely well done libraries of scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc. These are simply my explorations into the how the underlying math behind this stuff works and should serve only as a reference.

Happy hacking!
